# *****************************************************************************
# CODING STYLE > MAKING YOUR CODE READABLE
# *****************************************************************************


# 1. Avoid abbreviating variable names.
# 2. Write out your function argument names.
# 3. Document your classes and methods.
# 4. Comment your code.
# 5. Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
# 6. Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling
# should not be necessary to read an entire function or method.

# TIP: Use Flake8 for Checking Code Quality.


# *****************************************************************************
# CODING STYLE > THE WORD ON IMPORTS
# *****************************************************************************


# Imports should be grouped in the following order:

# 1. Standard library imports.
# 2. Core Django imports.
# 3. Third-party app imports.
# 4. Imports from your apps.

# Use explicit relative imports.
# Avoid using import *


# *****************************************************************************
# CODING STYLE > OTHERS
# *****************************************************************************


# Use underscores in URL pattern names rather than dashes.


# *****************************************************************************
# Deployment
# *****************************************************************************


# add your media, database, venv, __pycache__ to the .gitignore (there is a compelete list that you can find here: https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/blob/master/.gitignore)
# keep migration files in the git (you will need to migrate them in target server)
# don't run "makemigrations" in the target server (you will need to just run "migrate")
# $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
# make appropriate changes in your project settings.py file (change DEBUG to False and etc)
# push your code to your git-server
# pull your code in your target server
# give right permissions to the web-server (e.g. $ chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/myproject)
# make a new venv in the target server and activate it
# $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
# sudo ./venv/bin/python3 manage.py migrate
# restart your web-server (in case of apache: $ sudo service apache2 restart)

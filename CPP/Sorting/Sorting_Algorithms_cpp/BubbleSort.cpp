// Bubble Sort 

// Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is 
// comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is 
// compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

// This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its 
// average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n^2) where n is the number of items.

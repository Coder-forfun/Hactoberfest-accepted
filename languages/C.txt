main() Function

* The main() function is the starting point of the program: 	int main (int argc, char *argv[]) 
* The return type of the main() function is an integer (type int) and it is known as the return value of the program.
* As a rule of thumb, value 0 means success while non-zero means an error conditions.

Include Files

* The purpose of these files is to tell the compiler about the existence of external functions which the source code will make use of.

Preprocessor directives:
  #include "mine.h"	search current working directory first
  #include <stdio.h>	search command line directory then system
  #define TRUE 1	macro substitution, usually use capitals
  #define min(a,b) (a<b)?(a):(b)	macro substitution with parameters
  #define abs(a) (a<0)?(-(a)):(a)	macro substitution
  #define note /* comment */	this comment gets inserted every time note appears */
  backslash \ at end of a line means continue
  #undef TRUE	undefines a previously defined macroname
  #error	stop compiling at this point
  #if expression	conditional compilation, start if structure
  #elif expression	else if expression != 0 compile following code
  #else	else compile following code
  #endif	end of conditional compiling
  #ifdef macroname	like #if, compiles if macroname defined
  #ifndef	like #if, compiles if macroname undefined
  #line number [filename]	set origin for __LINE__ and __FILE__
  #pragma	gives the compiler commands

Create and execute a program

In Linux systems: 
    1. Open up a terminal
    2. Create the program: nano nameProgram.c
    3. Write the program and save it
    4. gcc -o nameExecutable nameProgram.c

enum	    enumeration type ( user defines the type name )

Type modifiers, prefix for basic types

Modifiers	  Description
signed	    has a sign ( default )
unsigned	  no sign bit in variable
long	      longer version of type (short or long alone means short int or
short	      shorter version of type long int because int is the default)
